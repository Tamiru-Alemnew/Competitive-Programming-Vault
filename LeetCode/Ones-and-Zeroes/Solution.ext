Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
