Input: nums = [2,1,3,4], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose element 2 which is 3 == (011)2, we flip the first bit and we obtain (010)2 == 2. nums becomes [2,1,2,4].
- Choose element 0 which is 2 == (010)2, we flip the third bit and we obtain (110)2 = 6. nums becomes [6,1,2,4].
The XOR of elements of the final array is (6 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 4) == 1 == k.
It can be shown that we cannot make the XOR equal to k in less than 2 operations.
