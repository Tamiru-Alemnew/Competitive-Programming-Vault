Input: nums1 = [3,2,5], nums2 = [2,2,1], diff = 1
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are 3 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
1. i = 0, j = 1: 3 - 2 <= 2 - 2 + 1. Since i < j and 1 <= 1, this pair satisfies the conditions.
2. i = 0, j = 2: 3 - 5 <= 2 - 1 + 1. Since i < j and -2 <= 2, this pair satisfies the conditions.
3. i = 1, j = 2: 2 - 5 <= 2 - 1 + 1. Since i < j and -3 <= 2, this pair satisfies the conditions.
Therefore, we return 3.
