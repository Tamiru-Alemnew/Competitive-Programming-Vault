Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
