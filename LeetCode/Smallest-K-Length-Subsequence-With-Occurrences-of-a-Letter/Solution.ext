Input: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1
Output: "eet"
Explanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:
- "lee" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "eet" (from "leet")
The lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".
