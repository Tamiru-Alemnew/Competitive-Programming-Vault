# Strange Printer II

Can you solve this real interview question? Strange Printer II - There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

 * On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.
 * Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, the same color cannot be used again.

You are given a m x n matrix targetGrid, where targetGrid[row][col] is the color in the position (row, col) of the grid.

Return true if it is possible to print the matrix targetGrid, otherwise, return false.

Input: targetGrid = [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,1,1,1]]
Output: true


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/23/print2.jpg]


Input: targetGrid = [[1,1,1,1],[1,1,3,3],[1,1,3,4],[5,5,1,4]]
Output: true


Example 3:


Input: targetGrid = [[1,2,1],[2,1,2],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to form targetGrid because it is not allowed to print the same color in different turns.
